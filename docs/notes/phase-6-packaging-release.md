# Phase 6 â€“ Packaging & Release

## What I Found
- Delivering RepoView as a polished desktop app demands cross-platform packaging, onboarding, and QA discipline.
- The initial plan did not spell out release engineering or documentation deliverables.

## What I Did
- Detailed tasks covering platform builds, code-signing, and auto-update strategy for the desktop app.
- Added onboarding, support documentation, and beta feedback loops to shepherd the tool toward production readiness.
