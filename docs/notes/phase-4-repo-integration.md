# Phase 4 â€“ Repo Integration & Collaboration

## What I Found
- Git awareness and collaboration are central to repo-centric workflows but were only implied in the description.
- Conflict handling for RVG JSON and multi-user awareness present unique challenges.

## What I Did
- Detailed Git status overlays, context actions, and remote provider hooks in the plan.
- Added tasks for RVG merge assistance and set the stage for future collaborative editing signals.
