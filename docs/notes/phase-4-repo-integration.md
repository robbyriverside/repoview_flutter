# Phase 4 â€“ Repo Integration & Collaboration

## What I Found
- Git awareness and collaboration are central to repo-centric workflows but were only implied in the description.
- Conflict handling for RVG JSON and multi-user awareness present unique challenges.

## What I Did
- Hooked the Git status service into the graph state with periodic refresh, sync-triggered updates, and safe fallbacks when Git is unavailable (`lib/main.dart:218`, `lib/main.dart:303`, `lib/services/git_status_service.dart`).
- Reworked the app bar to surface the active branch with dirty-change counts and layered Git-aware borders/badges on nodes, including folder aggregation and context-menu readouts (`lib/main.dart:218`, `lib/main.dart:356`, `lib/main.dart:848`).
- Extended the node context menu with Git actions for staging, unstaging, and diff viewing, plus an app-bar commit flow that shells out to Git with error handling (`lib/main.dart:170`, `lib/main.dart:1118`, `lib/services/git_status_service.dart:33`).
- Left the filesystem sync metadata intact while confirming file/folder cards continue to display size and sample info alongside the new Git overlays (`lib/rvg/rvg_sync_service.dart:60`).
- Added a toggleable commit-history drawer backed by `git log`, refreshed on demand, and exposed via the app bar (`lib/main.dart:173`, `lib/main.dart:371`, `lib/services/git_status_service.dart:192`).
- Implemented remote-tracking awareness with fetch controls, ahead/behind detection, and a presence banner that highlights the latest upstream author/time (`lib/main.dart:173`, `lib/main.dart:609`, `lib/services/git_status_service.dart:222`).
- Shipped an RVG merge helper that loads the remote `.repoview.rvg`, summarizes added/removed/modified nodes, and lets the user apply the snapshot locally (`lib/services/rvg_merge_service.dart`, `lib/main.dart:665`).
