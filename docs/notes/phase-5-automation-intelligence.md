# Phase 5 â€“ Automation & Intelligence

## What I Found
- RepoView aspires to automated layout and AI-assisted insights, but the roadmap lacked concrete automation milestones.
- Need to balance advanced features with privacy-respecting telemetry and extensibility.

## What I Did
- Captured layout formatters, AI tagging, and plugin automation as first-class tasks in the plan.
- Noted the requirement for template support and analytics pipelines that align with user consent.
