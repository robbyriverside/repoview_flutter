# Phase 5 – Automation & Intelligence

## What I Found
- Layout tooling was manual; authors had to drag nodes into order when the graph drifted.
- No structured way to re-use diagram presets or automate repetitive edits.
- The agent lacked “assistive” behaviours: no AI tagging, no telemetry for analysing interactions, and no way to script workflows.

## What I Did
- Added a `LayoutFormatterService` with grid, mind-map, and orthogonal layouts wired to a toolbar picker so diagrams can be normalised instantly (`lib/services/layout_formatter_service.dart`, `lib/main.dart:163-338`).
- Introduced AI-assisted tagging and summaries via `AiAssistantService`; nodes now surface suggested tags/metadata from the context menu (`lib/services/ai_assistant_service.dart`, `lib/main.dart:652-720`).
- Implemented desktop drag-and-drop so files dropped on the canvas copy into the workspace (or link when Shift is held) and sync immediately (`lib/main.dart:200-520`, `_handleDrop`).
- Created a template catalogue plus automation manager to stage reusable presets and programmable scripts (branch dashboards, snapshots) (`lib/services/rvg_template_service.dart`, `lib/services/automation_manager.dart`, `lib/main.dart:980-1132`).
- Embedded a telemetry pipeline with on-disk JSONL logging and an in-app activity panel so designers can inspect recent actions (`lib/services/telemetry_service.dart`, `lib/main.dart:338-420`, `lib/main.dart:1140-1188`).
- Added Flutter tests covering layout geometry and AI tag derivation to keep the new services from regressing (`test/layout_formatter_service_test.dart`, `test/ai_assistant_service_test.dart`).
